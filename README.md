This is a game in C# that doesn't really do anything right now

Eventually it'll be a super fun game about Potatoes. 

Or it won't be fun at all. Right now it's just a button, that tells you something about your life. 

i'm using this to get better at winforms, and github management

My primary language is Java, so I don't think C# will be too much of a jump. The syntax is already nicer than Python
